"""Post-training representational-drift probe for the DINOv3 LoRA Stage-4 arms.

Writes ``probe.json`` into the arm's results directory. Run by
``scripts/slurm/dinov3_lora_vitb.sbatch`` after ``train_done``, so every completed arm
carries its own diagnostics without a separate job.

Why this exists
---------------
The devbox gate G4.5 ("monitor ``losses/cls_cos`` every 500 steps; it should be smooth")
cannot work as written. Measured on a4u8g-0146 (STATUS finding 2), at init -- where LoRA is
*provably* an identity because B=0 -- the preservation scalars read:

    drop_path  mode   masking   gram      cls_mse   cls_cos
    0.0        eval   none      3.7e-09   4.3e-08   1.2e-07
    0.4        train  30%       2.4e-02   5.8e-01   9.3e-01

The in-training scalars are dominated by two things that have nothing to do with weight
drift: the student sees *masked* crops while the anchor sees unmasked ones, and stochastic
depth resamples a different sub-network every forward. A number that reads 0.93 when the
model is bit-for-bit the anchor cannot measure how far the model has moved from the anchor.

So drift is measured here instead, under conditions where identity actually implies zero:

  * ``model.eval()``       -- no stochastic depth, no dropout
  * ``masks=None``         -- student and anchor see identical pixels
  * ``torch.no_grad()``    -- inference only
  * fixed image subset     -- the same images for every arm, so arms are comparable
  * fp32 by default        -- see ``--fp32`` below

The anchor is the *pretrained* DINOv3 backbone, which under LoRA is exactly the frozen base
weights. So the reported numbers answer: how far has this arm's backbone moved away from
stock DINOv3, in the two geometries downstream consumers depend on?

    cls_cosine     global/CLS geometry  (k-NN, linear probe, retrieval consumers)
    gram_mse       patch geometry       (segmentation, depth, correspondence consumers)

Both are reported as raw drift, *not* as a loss, and the retention gates in the plan
(G4.2/G4.3) compare them across arms: the expected ordering is D <= C <= B < A.
